# [Chemical Gas Classification using Transfer Learning](https://github.com/lav30/Transfer-Learning-for-Gas-Sensor-Data)

- Established benchmarks for transfer learning using chemical gas sensor data.
- Utilised pre-trained models for unbalanced, time-series data.
- Achieved improved performance metrics for binary classification using pre-trained networks over traditional MLPs.
- Optimized several deep learning models to improve chemical gas identification.
